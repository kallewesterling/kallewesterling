<h1 align="center"> Hi there 👋 </h1>

<a href="https://mastodon.online/@kallewesterling" rel="me"><img src="https://img.shields.io/mastodon/follow/109246728246742706?domain=https%3A%2F%2Fmastodon.online&label=Follow%20me%20on%20Mastodon&style=social" alt="Follow me on Mastodon" /></a>

I’m **Kalle Westerling**, a **Product Manager at Chainguard**, where I lead **Chainguard Courses**—building engaging and effective training programs to support badging, product proficiency, and professional development for our customers and prospects and anyone interested in securing the software supply chain. My focus is on making technical concepts accessible and practical for users, ensuring they get the most out of our products.  

Previously, I worked at **The Alan Turing Institute**, the UK’s national institute for AI and data science. I started as a Research Software Engineer and later transitioned into a Product/Delivery Manager role, working on projects spanning **digital twinning, computer vision, and research software development**. My work emphasized user needs, accessibility, and reproducibility—helping researchers and developers create open, sustainable tools that drive impact.  

My background is rooted in **research and digital humanities**, particularly applying computational methods to historical and cultural data. I hold a Ph.D. in Theatre and Performance from The Graduate Center, CUNY, where [my dissertation](https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/4959/) analyzed networks of itinerant drag performers in 1930s America through digital humanities methodologies.  

## Past Work  

Before Chainguard, I worked on:  

- **[Living with Machines](https://github.com/living-with-machines)** – a large-scale research project combining historical archives with computational methods to study the impact of industrialization. I contributed to software development, data visualization, and public engagement efforts.  
- **[Data/Culture at The Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/dataculture-building-sustainable-communities-around-arts-and-humanities)** – helping build sustainable communities around arts and humanities datasets and tools, ensuring research software reaches broader audiences.  
- **[Nation-wide Digital Humanities infrastructure](https://www.dhinstitutes.org)** – working to develop digital humanities initiatives across multiple U.S. institutions, strengthening research communities and digital pedagogy.  

I’ve also written on **queer performance, digital humanities, and public humanities**, covering topics from [queer indie wrestlers](https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780367810016-13) and boylesque to the [**influence of RuPaul’s Drag Race on contemporary NYC drag**](https://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781350082977.ch-003).  

## Outside of Work  

When I’m not designing learning experiences, you’ll probably find me:  
- **Traveling** 🌍 – I’ve lived in Sweden, the U.S., Brazil, and the UK, and I love exploring new places.  
- **Practicing yoga** 🧘 – I recently became a certified yoga teacher after training in the Peruvian jungle.  
- **Cooking & enjoying great food** 🍽️ – I love experimenting in the kitchen and discovering amazing meals wherever I go.
