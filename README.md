### Hi there 👋

I am a performance scholar and historian. My doctoral research analyzes itinerant drag performers around New York and along the Eastern Seaboard in the 1930s as part of a collective art form that brought queerness with them to towns and cities around the area. I have also written on topics ranging from queer indie wrestlers, boylesque and male-identified strippers in neo-burlesque, and the influence of RuPaul’s Drag Race on the livelihood and aesthetics of contemporary New York City drag queens.

Previously, I was the project manager for the NEH-funded project [“Expanding Communities of Practice”](https://www.dhinstitutes.org), aimed at helping to create infrastructure for digital humanities across several higher education institutions across the U.S. He is a member of the Steering Committee of [HASTAC, the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory](https://www.hastac.org).
