<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

**I am a dedicated and results-oriented professional with academic preparation seeking to transition to a career in the private sector or in a digital scholarship lab, preferably with focus on humanities-oriented projects. In my latest position, I was responsible for [building nation-wide infrastructure and community for digital humanities across several higher education institutions across the U.S.](https://www.dhinstitutes.org) My conference participation has been centered around topics such as the Digital Humanities, the Public Humanities, and on how to leverage digital technology for effective pedagogy.**

I am a performance scholar and historian by training. My doctoral research analyzes itinerant drag performers around New York and along the Eastern Seaboard in the 1930s as part of a collective art form that brought queerness with them to towns and cities around the area. My dissertation project was awarded a Connect New York grant for its innovative use of digital methods in Theatre and Performance.

I have written on topics ranging from [queer indie wrestlers](https://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9780367810016-13), boylesque and male-identified strippers in neo-burlesque, and the [influence of RuPaulâ€™s Drag Race on the livelihood and aesthetics of contemporary New York City drag queens](https://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781350082977.ch-003). You can also find me on the Steering Committee of [HASTAC, the Humanities, Arts, Science, and Technology Alliance and Collaboratory](https://www.hastac.org).
